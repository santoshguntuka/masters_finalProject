Predictive Modeling in Genomics
Abstract
This research project delves deep into predictive modeling in genomics using simulated genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Motivated by the diverse challenges posed by unique patterns of association, including additivity, epistasis, and genetic heterogeneity, the primary objectives encompass the application of feature importance analysis, a spectrum of machine learning algorithms, and advanced statistical methodologies.

By examining eight distinct datasets, each simulated with varying numbers of features and underlying association patterns, the research seeks to optimize prediction performance while discerning between predictive and non-predictive features. The project incorporates methodologies responsible for relief-based feature selection, exploring techniques for enhancing model interpretability, visualization tools, comparative analyses, and model interpretability techniques.

The findings are expected to not only advance the understanding of predictive modeling in genomics but also provide insights into potential applications in biological and medical institutes. This research acts as a basis for future investigations into the development of robust predictive models in the field of genomics and precision medicine.
