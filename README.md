# Predictive Modeling in Genomics

## Abstract
This research project delves deep into predictive modeling in genomics using simulated genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Motivated by the diverse challenges posed by unique patterns of association, including additivity, epistasis, and genetic heterogeneity, the primary objectives encompass the application of feature importance analysis, a spectrum of machine learning algorithms, and advanced statistical methodologies.

By examining eight distinct datasets, each simulated with varying numbers of features and underlying association patterns, the research seeks to optimize prediction performance while discerning between predictive and non-predictive features. The project incorporates methodologies responsible for relief-based feature selection, exploring techniques for enhancing model interpretability, visualization tools, comparative analyses, and model interpretability techniques.

The findings are expected to not only advance the understanding of predictive modeling in genomics but also provide insights into potential applications in biological and medical institutes. This research acts as a basis for future investigations into the development of robust predictive models in the field of genomics and precision medicine.

## Introduction
This project aims to explore predictive modeling in genomics through the use of simulated SNP datasets. We address the challenges posed by additivity, epistasis, and genetic heterogeneity, focusing on optimizing prediction performance and distinguishing between predictive and non-predictive features.

## Datasets
We examine eight distinct datasets, each simulated with varying numbers of features and underlying association patterns. These datasets are designed to test the robustness and accuracy of different predictive modeling approaches.

## Methodology

### Feature Importance Analysis
We apply various techniques to analyze the importance of features within the datasets. This involves relief-based feature selection methods that enhance model interpretability and help identify the most significant SNPs contributing to prediction accuracy.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
A spectrum of machine learning algorithms is employed to build predictive models. These include but are not limited to:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

### Statistical Methodologies
Advanced statistical methodologies are integrated into the modeling process to improve prediction accuracy and handle the complexity of genomic data.

## Results

### Visualization Tools
We utilize various visualization tools to illustrate the performance of different models and the importance of features. These tools help in understanding the underlying patterns in the data and the efficacy of different approaches.

### Comparative Analyses
Comparative analyses are conducted to evaluate the performance of different models and methodologies. This involves comparing prediction accuracy, feature importance rankings, and model interpretability across the eight datasets.

### Model Interpretability
Techniques for enhancing model interpretability are explored, aiming to make the predictive models more transparent and understandable to researchers and practitioners in genomics.

### Key Findings
- **Random Forest:** Achieved high accuracy and robustness across all datasets, effectively handling feature interactions and non-linear relationships.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Performed well on datasets with clear margins of separation but struggled with noisy data.
